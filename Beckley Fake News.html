            <p>
                Citizens of Becley were shocked this week when the Beckley library announced
                Cookout near walmart wasn't real. A student at WVU Tech tried to check out a burger
                there, but was denied service. Causing a mass confusion, the library stepped in to clarify
                the situation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Officials say the decision was made after finding plastic burgers. Yes we said plastic burgers.
            </p>

            <p> 
                Many of the citizens are upset about the establishment.

        <div class="title">Student Accidentally Finishes Homework Early</div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                A student reportedly finished homework two days early, leaving
                classmates confused and concerned. Once teacher found out it was
                a mistake, the student was assigned extra work. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can't believe it," said one classmate. "Who finishes homework early?
                That's just not normal."
            </p>
            <p>
                Scientists say this event is extremely rare and may never happen again. If it does happen again, it will likely be on a weekend.
